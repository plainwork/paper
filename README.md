# paper

Paper is a tiny menu bar app for plain text notes. It does less than real paper, but that is the point.

## Install

Install via Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew tap plainwork/paper https://github.com/plainwork/homebrew-paper
brew install --cask paper
```

Or install directly:

```bash
brew install --cask plainwork/paper/paper
```

## Use

- Click the Paper icon in the menu bar to open the editor.
- Type freely with full copy/paste and newline support.
- Toggle with the hotkey: `control+option+command+P`.
- Quit from the inline Quit link or press `command+Q`.
